    <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.

        A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.<br>
        Full-stack developers design and create websites and applications for various platforms. A full-stack developerâ€™s job description might include the following:

        Develop and maintain web services and interfaces
        
        Contribute to front-end and back-end development processes
        
        Build new product features or APIs
        
        Perform tests, troubleshoot software, and fix bugs
        
        Collaborate with other departments on projects and sprints
        
        The world of full-stack development is large, and many new and evolving technologies continually push the limits of what a full-stack developer can create. Staying on top of cutting-edge technology and techniques in the full-stack development field is one of the many exciting aspects of working in this role. 
        
        According to LinkedIn's 2020 Canada Emerging Jobs Report, the industries with the most full-stack developer jobs are:
